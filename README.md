# ProteinTurnoverEcoli
This repository contains the scripts for obtaining half lives from the input peptide data in the csv format. 
To download the input data csv files and the resulting output cvs files containing half lives, please refer to the link: 
https://zenodo.org/records/10672712


To run the scripts create a new environment with the following packages: 
        1.Python 3.9.12
        2.Pandas version_1.4.2
        3.Numpy version_1.21.5
        4.Matplolib version_3.5.1
        5.Scipy version_1.7.3
        6.Sklearn version_1.0.2
        7.Seaborn version_0.11.2
        8.Pingouin version_0.5.3


Then clone this git repository locally. 

To run the scripts the input file from the above link needs to be pasted in the respective folder. The input files start with the name of the condition. 
and then run the individual jupyter notebooks. 
An example for "Clim12 Replicate 1"  is demonstarted below. Follow the steps after cloning the git repository: 
1. Open the drive. Navigate to the folder C12 > Replicate1_C12.
2. Download the file Clim12_set1.csv to your local computer.
3. Copy this file to clipboard.
4. Navigate to the cloned git directory on your local computer.
5. Navigate to the folder C12 > Replicate1_C12.
6. Paste the input file in this folder.
7. Run the jupyter notebook.
8. This will produce the resulting half-life files which can be matched to the output files uploaded on the link above.
